##Technology for Good
We share a mission with our parent organization, [Code for America](http://codeforamerica.org):

>We build open source technology and organize a network of people dedicated to making government services simple, effective, and easy to use.

At Code for Sacramento, we try and keep the following goals in mind as we do this:

- make it better to live in our city and state

- increase civic engagement

- learn and teach

- help anyone who wants to help

For a full breakdown of what we're doing this year, please see our [strategic plan](https://github.com/code4sac/2015-Strategic-Plan).
